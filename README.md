# Easy Split - My quick overview of the Kotlin code.
This app is capable of managing group expenses with an effective algorithm to discover who owes who what money in the group.
My Database schemas for both SQL and Firebase databases can be found in the workings directory.

I created this app by myself, please take a look at the code and/ or download the app. I am open to any suggestions, improvements etc. I believe I have named classes/ data structures/ functions and variables in a self-explantory way for easy comprehenesion. You can e-mail me at dan96.austin@gmail.com

After I made the application function in an efficient way, I read the book Clean Code and instantaneously saw how my code could be improved. I now see that code doesn't just need to work, it also needs to be read. This simple rule changed the way I structured the app and since then I have re-factored the application in a major way to show my my recognition of this simple but supremely important rule.

Some points:
   - SQL is used for offline use. Firebase for syncing all group changes and expenses with the rest of the group, and of course for new users who want to join an existing group.##
   - I have made use OOP principles with the great language Kotlin. I really found Kotlin a joy to work with and to learn.
   - I loved creating this app. There were moments in some crazy debugging sessions where I thought I would never find the solutions, but I always did. 
   - I see now how Unit tests can be of huge benefit to the develepment lifecyle, especially TDD. I plan to implement Unit tests when I have the time after I have landed a job as       most of my time now will be commited to searching for the correct company for me and creating a cover letter etc fot he application.
